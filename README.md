## ChibiOsThreads DLL Description:

The ChibiOsThreads DLL is a powerful tool designed to enhance the debugging experience for projects utilizing the ChibiOS real-time operating system (RTOS). This DLL provides visibility into the internal threads managed by ChibiOS, enabling developers to monitor and analyze thread execution during debugging sessions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Thread Visualization:** Gain insight into ChibiOS threads directly within your debugging environment. The DLL retrieves information about active threads, including their names, execution status, and saved registers.

2. **Efficient Thread Management:** The DLL efficiently manages thread information retrieval, minimizing overhead and ensuring smooth debugging performance, even in projects with a large number of threads.

3. **Enhanced Debugging:** With the ChibiOsThreads DLL, developers can track thread execution, inspect thread contexts, and identify potential issues or bottlenecks within their ChibiOS-based applications.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Create Directory:** Navigate to the RTOSProfiles directory in your Visual GDB installation directory. For example, if your Visual GDB is installed in `c:\Program Files (x86)\Sysprogs\VisualGDB`, the directory path would be `c:\Program Files (x86)\Sysprogs\VisualGDB\RTOSProfiles`. Inside this directory, create a new folder named `com.sysprog.chibios`.

2. **Copy DLL:** Copy the compiled DLL file of ChibiOsThreads to the newly created `com.sysprog.chibios` directory.

3. **Add RTOS Configuration:** Copy the `RTOS.xml` file from the root of the ChibiOsThreads repository to the `com.sysprog.chibios` directory.

Once these steps are completed, the ChibiOsThreads DLL will be available for use within Visual GDB, allowing you to enhance your debugging experience with ChibiOS threads.
